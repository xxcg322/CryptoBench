# CryptoBench: A Benchmark for Evaluating Large Language Models in Cryptography

## Overview

CryptoBench is a comprehensive benchmark designed to assess the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in understanding and applying cryptographic concepts, tools, and networks. Our goal is to create a robust evaluation framework that pushes the boundaries of AI in the crypto space.

## Project Components

1. **Question Datasets**
   - MVP Dataset: 727 multiple-choice questions for rapid LLM evaluation
   - Task Dataset: 230 complex tasks 

2. **Automated Testing Framework**
   - Currently implemented for the MVP Dataset
   - Future development planned for the Task Dataset

3. **Agent Framework (Planned)**
   - Crypto-native framework for controlling private keys and performing on-chain operations

## Datasets in Detail

### MVP Dataset

- 727 multiple-choice questions
- Human-AI collaborative creation process:
  1. Humans source specific materials
  2. AI models generate questions based on these materials
  3. Human experts review and refine the questions
- Continuously expanding and improving for better coverage and quality
- We welcome error reports and suggestions for improvement

### Task Dataset

- 230 complex tasks covering:
  - Q&A
  - MEV/arbitrage scenario simulations
  - Lightning Network operation simulations
  - Smart contract auditing
  - Smart contract optimization
- All contract auditing questions derived from or adapted from real contracts and vulnerabilities
- Contributed by multiple human experts
- Currently lacks automated evaluation due to complexity
- Future goal: Establish effective automated testing and scoring system for complex tasks

## Future Directions

1. **Agent Framework Development**
   - Create a crypto-native framework for real-world blockchain interactions
   - Enable testing on test networks and live environments
   - Seeking contributors to initiate this crucial component

2. **Knowledge Graph Construction**
   - Comprehensive mapping of the cryptography domain
   - Will inform future dataset construction and benchmark refinement

3. **Collaborative Expansion**
   - CryptoBench is envisioned as a collective effort
   - We welcome contributions from the wider crypto and AI communities
   - Contributors will be acknowledged as co-authors in future publications

## Current Status

All current work should be viewed as a Proof of Concept. We are actively working towards building a robust, comprehensive benchmark that covers all aspects of the cryptography field.
