## CryptoBench: A crypto-focus LLM Benchmark

CryptoBench is a comprehensive benchmark designed to assess the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in understanding and applying cryptographic concepts, tools, and networks. Our goal is to create a robust evaluation framework that pushes the boundaries of AI in the crypto space.

### Leaderboard (updated on 2025.04.10)

**Important Note:** As AI models have evolved rapidly, the existing Q&A-based tests no longer provide sufficient differentiation between newer models, with scores becoming increasingly clustered at the high end. Since April 2025, we have discontinued running these traditional tests on new models and are transitioning to more challenging agent-driven real-world task benchmarks.

## Future Directions: From Q&A to Agent-Driven Real-World Tasks

CryptoBench is evolving beyond traditional Q&A benchmarks. We are transitioning to a more sophisticated evaluation framework where AI agents perform actual crypto-world tasks. 

### ðŸš€ BenchmarkAgent Framework (POC Available)

We have developed a proof-of-concept agent framework that demonstrates this new approach. The **[BenchmarkAgent](./benchagent/)** is a specialized intelligent agent framework for blockchain benchmarking that:

- **Automatically decomposes complex blockchain tasks** into executable steps using LLM
- **Generates Solidity contracts and Python scripts** for blockchain interactions
- **Executes complete blockchain workflows** with error feedback and retry mechanisms
- **Tests real-world scenarios** including DeFi protocols, NFT operations, and DAO governance


Key features:
- ðŸ¤– LLM-driven task planning and code generation
- ðŸ”„ Intelligent error feedback loop for code improvement
- ðŸ“Š Comprehensive execution logging and result tracking
- ðŸ§ª 10 progressive test tasks from simple queries to complex DeFi interactions

[Learn more about BenchmarkAgent â†’](./benchagent/README.md)

### Why This Transition?

- **Limited Differentiation**: Current Q&A tests no longer effectively differentiate between advanced models
- **Real-World Relevance**: Agent-driven tasks better reflect actual crypto development scenarios
- **Dynamic Challenges**: Real tasks require understanding complex interactions between smart contracts, protocols, and networks

### What's Next?

1. **Agent Framework Enhancement**
   - Building a robust crypto-native agent framework for real-world blockchain interactions
   - Enabling comprehensive testing on test networks and live environments

2. **New Dataset Construction**
   - Developing tasks that require actual blockchain interaction
   - Creating challenges that test understanding of DeFi protocols, smart contract deployment, and security auditing in practice

3. **Community Collaboration**
   - We welcome contributions from the crypto and AI communities
   - Help us define the next generation of crypto AI benchmarks
